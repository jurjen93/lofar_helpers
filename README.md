## LOFAR helper scripts

These scripts were developed for reducing LOFAR data for the following studies:
- Study of the bridge between galaxy clusters A399 and A401: https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13930
- Producing the deepest sub-arcsecond wide-field image of ELAIS-N1: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13247v1

Although the scripts were developed for specific purposes, 
I have tried to write them such that they can be used for more general use-cases as well.
Some of these scripts have been integrated in data reduction pipelines as well.
You are free to use the scripts for your own work.

Install with: ```pip install -v git+https://github.com/jurjen93/lofar_helpers.git```
This gives you the following command line functions:
- ```split_polygon_facets```
- ```crop_nan_boundaries```
- ```cut_fits_with_region```
- ```close_h5```
- ```concat_with_dummies```
- ```remove_flagged_stations```
- `applycal`
- `subtract_with_wsclean`

Use ```--help``` to get more details about the functionalities.
