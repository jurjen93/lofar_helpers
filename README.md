## LOFAR helper scripts

These scripts are helper script for LOFAR data reduction.\
Scripts were used for imaging and recalibrating A399-401 (see paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13930) but can be used for other purposes for reducing LOFAR data as well.

Clone repo with: ```git clone https://github.com/jurjen93/lofar_helpers.git``` \
If you are only interested in ```h5_merger.py```, use:\
```wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jurjen93/lofar_helpers/master/h5_merger.py"```

Two standalone scripts are briefly discussed below:

-------------------------------
## 1. Merge solutions

With ```h5_merger.py``` it is possible to merge H5parm solution files (often ending on .h5), which are used in LOFAR (self-)calibration.
These files contain 'sol000' or 'sol001' or other solution set names. Within these solution sets there has to be a source and antenna table. 
They should also contain 'amplitude000' and/or 'phase000' solution tables. The script will most likely crash or not perform well when one of the above is not satisfied.
If you want to see the structure of your input solution file, you can run ```h5_helpers/test_input.py```.
This script has also other functionalities, such as time and frequency averaging or linear to circular conversion and vice versa. 
These can be independently used from the merging functionality. Find all the options below.

```h5_merger.py``` is compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3.

### Special requirements

```h5_mergers.py``` uses the following libraries:
* ```losoto``` (install with ```pip install lososto```)
* ```casacore.tables``` (install with ```pip install python-casacore```)
* ```numpy```
* ```scipy```
* ```tables```

#### Usage

There are two ways to use this script, by importing directly into your python script or by using the command line. 

#### Python import
Import the main function with: \
```from h5_merger import merge_h5```\
\
You can use these variables:

* ```h5_out``` --> H5 file output name. This name cannot be in the list of input H5 files.
* ```h5_tables``` --> H5 tables input files (can be both given as list with wildcard or string).
* ```ms_files``` --> MS input files (can be both given as list with wildcard or string).
* ```h5_time_freq``` --> H5 file to use time and frequency arrays from. This is useful if the input h5 files do not have the preferred time/freq resolution.
* ```convert_tec``` --> Convert TEC to phase.
* ```merge_all_in_one``` --> Merge all solutions into one single direction.
* ```lin2circ``` --> Transform linear polarization to circular.
* ```circ2lin``` --> Transform circular polarization to linear.
* ```add_directions``` --> Add direction with amplitude 1 and phase 0 (example: --add_direction [0.73,0.12]).
* ```single_pol``` --> Return only a single polarization axis if both polarizations are the same.
* ```no_pol``` --> Remove polarization axis if both polarizations are the same.
* ```use_solset``` --> Choose a solset to merge from your input H5 files.
* ```filtered_dir``` --> Filter out a list of indexed directions from your H5 file. Only lists allowed (example: --filter_directions [2,3]).
* ```add_cs``` --> Add core stations to antenna output from MS (needs --ms).
* ```use_ants_from_ms``` --> Use only antenna stations from measurement set (needs --ms). Note that this is different to --add_cs, as it does not keep the international stations if these are not in the MS.
* ```check_output``` --> Check if the output has all the correct output information.
* ```time_av``` --> Time averaging factor.
* ```freq_av``` --> Frequency averaging factor.
* ```check_flagged_station``` --> Check if input stations are flagged, if so flag same stations in output.
* ```propagate_flags``` --> Interpolate weights and return in output file.
* ```no_antenna_check``` --> Do not compare antennas.

#### Command line
Use the script with the command line with the following parameters with ```python h5_merger.py <PARAM>```:
* ```--h5_out``` --> H5 file output name. This name cannot be in the list of input H5 files.
* ```--h5_tables``` --> H5 tables input files (can be both given as list with wildcard or string).
* ```--ms``` --> MS input files (can be both given as list with wildcard or string).
* ```--h5_time_freq``` --> H5 file to use time and frequency arrays from. This is useful if the input h5 files do not have the preferred time/freq resolution.
* ```--time_av``` --> Time averaging factor.
* ```--freq_av``` --> Frequency averaging factor.
* ```--keep_tec``` --> Do not convert TEC to phase.
* ```--merge_all_in_one``` --> Merge all solutions into one single direction.
* ```--lin2circ``` --> Transform linear polarization to circular.
* ```--circ2lin``` --> Transform circular polarization to linear.
* ```--add_direction``` --> Add direction with amplitude 1 and phase 0 (example: --add_direction [0.73,0.12]).
* ```--single_pol``` --> Return only a single polarization axis if both polarizations are the same.
* ```--no_pol``` --> Remove polarization axis if both polarizations are the same.
* ```--usesolset``` --> Choose a solset to merge from your input H5 files.
* ```--filter_directions``` --> Filter out a list of indexed directions from your H5 file. Only lists allowed (example: --filter_directions [2,3]).
* ```--add_cs``` --> Add core stations to antenna output from MS (needs --ms).
* ```--use_ants_from_ms``` --> Use only antenna stations from measurement set (needs --ms). Note that this is different to --add_cs, as it does not keep the international stations if these are not in the MS.
* ```--check_output``` --> Check if the output has all the correct output information.
* ```--not_flagstation``` --> Do not flag any station if station is flagged in input h5.
* ```--propagate_flags``` --> Interpolate weights and return in output file.
* ```--no_antenna_check``` --> Do not compare antennas.

Or use the help function to list all the funcationalities in your version of ```h5_merger.py``` with:\
```python h5_merger.py -h```

## 2. Make boxes for LOFAR self-calibration

With ```make_boxes.py``` it is possible to make boxes around sources that can be extracted and self-calibrated.\
Note that this script only works with Python 3.

#### Usage

Use ```make_boxes.py``` as a standalone script with Python 3, by running on the command line:\
```python make_boxes.py <FLAGS>``` \
You can use the following flags:
* ```--file``` --> followed by the fits file name (and path)
* ```--location``` --> followed by the location (path) to store the data
* ```--no_images``` --> don't save the images locally
* ```--ds9``` --> interactive mode to validate the box selection in ds9
* ```--max_boxes``` --> max number of boxes

The script returns the following:
* directory with .reg region boxes.
* directory with box images, to check the quality of the boxes.

#### Details
The following steps are taken in the algorithm:
* Determine (surface brightness) pixels that go over the threshold >0.07.
* Loop through all peak fluxes (sources) and check if these are already included in other images. If so, we stop here.
* Check if the source is 'interesting' by comparing the outlier fluxes in the images with the outliers in a gaussian filtered version. If not, we stop here.
* Reposition the image by taking into account the borders where we don't want to have high flux peaks or other sources. This is done by moving the center of the image and resizing.
* We also look for islands of flux, which we find by binning 100x100 pixels and summing over these pixels. When the flux exceeds 30, we extract a box from this position.
* If there are multiple peak fluxes (sources) we flag these as done from our list.
* Now we save the image of the box and the .reg.
