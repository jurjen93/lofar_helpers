How to run the pipeline:

CURRENTLY:
- Run strw/extract_serie.sh                     -> copies necessary files, makes boxes, extracts in series
- Run strw/move_result_extract_strw-surf.sh     -> moves .reg files and .ms.archive0 files to surf
- Run surf/selfcal_parallal.sh                  -> runs selfcals in parallel mode
- Run surf/merge_all_solutions.sh               -> merges all solutions
- Run surf/move_result_selfcal_surf-strw.sh     -> moves end solution file back to strw

FUTURE:
- Automate full process
- Run extract also parallel
- Fix password problem
