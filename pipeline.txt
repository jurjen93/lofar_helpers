----PIPELINE STEPS----

1) MAKE BOXES with make_boxes.py (including interactive adaptation)

2) EXTRACT sources with supporting_scripts/reinout/sub-sources-outside-region.py

3) Cut/flag data with prepare_data_...py

4) SELFCAL sources with supporting_scripts/reinout/runwscleanLBautoR.py
(needs to be done whenever a box is extracted)

5) MERGE SOLUTIONS with merge_selfcals.sh
(needs to be done when all solutions are there)

6) DECIDE WHICH SOLUTIONS ARE GOOD ENOUGH
(currently manually)

7) MAKE IMAGE with make_new_image.py

EXTRA: Use database in between to check which boxes are done

- implement automation for step 5)
- make sure that user just gives location of the repo of the image that has to be improved and location where files are going to be created and dumped
- make sure that user has all needed scripts
- make sure there is enough available space
- self-monitoring
